This code outputs a file with 101011 but it was not a binary file.
I thought about using write function to output the binary file, but it takes char pointer and the length. Is there any way to solve this problem?? By the way, the file size must be compressed. I tried to output binary file with string but the size was increased.. This is for Huffman encoding and decoding!!
Thanks!
